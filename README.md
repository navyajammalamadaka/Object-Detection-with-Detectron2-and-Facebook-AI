# Object-Detection-with-Detectron2-and-Facebook-AI

1. Used the COCO Keypoint Person Detector model with a ResNet50-FPN base network, which is trained to detect human silhouettes to detect as
many silhouettes of people in the test image as possible. 
2. Repeated same procedure, but with the Mask R-CNN model with ResNet50-FPN backbone, to detect both people as well as other
objects in the scene.
3. Pre-trained Mask R-CNN model and trained a balloon detector using the (fine-tuning) balloon image dataset and tested it on the original test image.
